## News

### The research for efficient stable diffusion, `BK-SDM`, is released!

**2023. 07. 19.**
I participated in stable diffusion model compression research in [Nota AI](https://www.nota.ai/), and published the paper, the model named [BK-SDM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15798), with our teammates.
We compressed a conditional U-Net in stable diffusion with knowledge distillation method and found that the compressed model can sustain the original performance while finetuning with tiny dataset.
Please check our [code](https://github.com/Nota-NetsPresso/BK-SDM) and [other related work](https://huggingface.co/blog/sd_distillation) introduced by [Segmind](https://github.com/segmind/distill-sd).

### `ml-talking-face` server is dead...

**2023. 05. 29.**
The core part of the demonstration in [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/CVPR/ml-talking-face) has been working on the AWS instance of Maum AI (ex-MINDsLab), and I found that it canâ€™t connect to the instance now. I want to fix this issue, but Iâ€™m sorry to say that I left the company months ago.
I contacted the company, but they didn't have any plan to sustain this demo (due to cost-cutting)... If youâ€™re in a hurry for further research, please send the e-mail directly to Maum AI (hello@maum.ai) or their website.

I'll do my best to provide the demo in other ways. Whatever the reason, Iâ€™m sorry again. Hope you understand. 

### Answers for questions about `ml-talking-face`

**2023. 02. 06.**
In last year, I got so many questions about [Hugging Face Demo `ml-talking-face`](https://huggingface.co/spaces/CVPR/ml-talking-face) and paper through Hugging Face Spaces, Youtube, GitHub, and LinkedIn. 
Today, I updated the answers for frequently asked questions at our [model card](https://huggingface.co/deepkyu/ml-talking-face). 
It will be also updated at [`ml-talking-face` github repository](https://github.com/deepkyu/ml-talking-face). 
I hope this help with your journey in talking face generation and multilingual TTS research.
